# Mario Browser - Vanilla JS
First big project which i wrote in vanilla JS when I started my way with JS and web development.
Based on simple game engine which I developed, can be extended and modified to support other games such as [IceTower](https://github.com/TomaszKisiel/icy-tower), which I also created with its help.
